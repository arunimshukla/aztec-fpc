## 1. Overview

The Fee Payment Contract (FPC) lets users pay Aztec L2 transaction fees in a single fixed token instead of the native Fee Juice. An operator runs the FPC, receives fee payments as private notes, and keeps the FPC funded with Fee Juice bridged from L1.


The protocol has three components:

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **FPC** (Aztec.nr contract) | Fee-payer contract used in Alpha; handles user fee intent and covers protocol Fee Juice via the attestation + top-up service model |
| **Attestation Service** (TypeScript) | REST API that signs user-specific amount quotes; `FPC` verifies these on-chain |
| **Top-up Service** (TypeScript) | Background process that monitors the FPC's Fee Juice balance and bridges more from L1 when it runs low |

## 3. Contract: FPC

### 3.1 Storage

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | `PublicImmutable<Config>` | Packed immutable config: `operator`, `operator_pubkey_x`, `operator_pubkey_y`. |

The contract keeps one packed immutable config slot and no mutable admin state after deployment.

### 3.2 Quote Format

All quotes are user-specific. The inner hash preimage is:

```
inner_hash = poseidon2([
    DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,    // "FPC" = 0x465043
    fpc_address,
    accepted_asset,      // selected in quote request and bound by signature
    fj_fee_amount,
    aa_payment_amount,
    valid_until,         // unix timestamp (u64)
    user_address,        // always msg_sender — never zero
])
```

The operator signs this hash off-chain with Schnorr (64-byte signature). The user passes signature bytes as `quote_sig` to `fee_entrypoint`, and the FPC verifies it inline with `schnorr::assert_valid_signature` against the stored operator pubkey.

The contract pushes `quote_hash` as a nullifier, so consumed quotes cannot be replayed.

### 3.3 Exchange Rate

The operator sets baseline rate values in the attestation config:
- `market_rate_num / market_rate_den` — base exchange rate (asset units per 1 FeeJuice)
- `fee_bips` — operator margin in basis points (e.g. 200 = 2%)

For multi-asset deployments, each `supported_assets` entry may override those values with asset-specific `market_rate_num`, `market_rate_den`, and `fee_bips`.

The service computes the **final rate**:
```
final_rate_num = market_rate_num × (10000 + fee_bips)
final_rate_den = market_rate_den × 10000
```

At quote time, users provide `accepted_asset` + `fj_amount`; the service resolves the selected asset's pricing policy and returns a fixed `aa_payment_amount`:

```
aa_payment_amount = ceil(fj_amount × final_rate_num / final_rate_den)
```

For `FPC.fee_entrypoint`, `fj_amount` must match `max_gas_cost_no_teardown` for the transaction gas settings.

### 3.4 Payment Flow

#### `fee_entrypoint(accepted_asset, authwit_nonce, fj_fee_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, quote_sig)`

```
User private balance →[transfer_private_to_private]→ Operator private balance
```

1. Reads packed `config` from storage (`operator`, signing pubkey)
2. Verifies Schnorr quote signature and binds `user_address = msg_sender`
3. Pushes quote nullifier (replay protection; duplicates fail via nullifier conflict)
4. Asserts `anchor_block_timestamp ≤ valid_until`
5. Asserts `(valid_until - anchor_block_timestamp) ≤ 3600` seconds
6. Asserts `fj_fee_amount == get_max_gas_cost_no_teardown(...)`
7. Calls `Token::at(accepted_asset).transfer_private_to_private(sender → operator, aa_payment_amount, nonce)`
8. For fee-paying txs (any non-zero `maxFeesPerGas` lane), asserts setup-phase execution (`!in_revertible_phase`), then calls `set_as_fee_payer()` + `end_setup()`

The token transfer is a private function call that executes in the setup phase, before `end_setup()`. It is irrevocably committed. If the user's app logic subsequently reverts, the fee has still been paid — this is unavoidable in the Aztec FPC model.

No teardown is scheduled. No tokens accumulate in this contract's balance.

### 3.5 Function Reference

| Function | Aztec context | Callable by |
|---|---|---|
| `constructor(operator, operator_pubkey_x, operator_pubkey_y)` | public | anyone (one-time initializer) |
| `fee_entrypoint(accepted_asset, authwit_nonce, fj_fee_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, quote_sig)` | private | any user (quote binds to caller) |

> There are no admin functions. The contract has no mutable state after construction.

### 3.6 Fee Revenue

All fee payments arrive in the **operator's private balance** directly. The operator is responsible for off-chain accounting and must use their PXE to discover incoming private notes.

The FPC itself holds no token balance. Its only balance is Fee Juice (protocol-level), which the Aztec protocol deducts automatically per transaction and is replenished by the Top-up Service.

## 4. Attestation Service

### 4.1 Responsibilities

- Hold the `operator` private key
- Compute final exchange rates (market rate + operator bips), including per-asset overrides
- Sign user-specific quotes on demand
- Publish machine-readable discovery metadata for wallet endpoint resolution

### 4.2 API Reference

#### `GET /.well-known/fpc.json`
Returns wallet discovery metadata for this attestation instance.

```json
{
  "discovery_version": "1.0",
  "attestation_api_version": "1.0",
  "network_id": "aztec-alpha-local",
  "fpc_address": "0x...",
  "contract_variant": "fpc-v1",
  "quote_base_url": "https://attestation.operator.example",
  "endpoints": {
    "discovery": "/.well-known/fpc.json",
    "health": "/health",
    "accepted_assets": "/accepted-assets",
    "quote": "/quote"
  },
  "supported_assets": [{ "address": "0x...", "name": "humanUSDC" }]
}
```

Wallet resolution key is `(network_id, asset_address, fpc_address)`. Resolution order and fallback behavior are specified in [`wallet-discovery-spec.md`](./wallet-discovery-spec.md).
Use HTTPS for `quote_base_url` in production; HTTP is acceptable for local development.

#### `GET /health`
Returns `{ status: "ok" }`. Use for liveness probes.

#### `GET /accepted-assets`
Returns the supported accepted-assets list.

```json
[
  { "name": "humanUSDC", "address": "0x..." },
  { "name": "ravenETH", "address": "0x..." }
]
```

#### `GET /quote?user=<address>&accepted_asset=<address>&fj_amount=<positive_u128_decimal>`
Returns a user-specific quote for the caller. The `user` address is bound into the quote signature — only that user can use this quote.

```json
{
  "accepted_asset": "0x...",
  "fj_amount": "1000000",
  "aa_payment_amount": "1020",
  "valid_until": "1740000300",
  "signature": "0x..."
}
```

The user passes `(accepted_asset, fj_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, signature)` to `fee_entrypoint`. Only the token transfer authwit is carried in `authWitnesses`.

Deterministic `400 BAD_REQUEST` responses cover missing/invalid `user`, missing/invalid `accepted_asset`, unsupported `accepted_asset`, missing/invalid `fj_amount`, and computed overflow for `aa_payment_amount`.

### 4.3 Quote Signing Internals

The service uses `computeInnerAuthWitHash` (from `@aztec/stdlib/auth-witness`) to compute the same quote hash as `assert_valid_quote`, using the request-selected `accepted_asset`, then signs the 32-byte hash payload with the operator Schnorr key and returns a 64-byte hex signature.

### 4.4 Wallet Discovery Contract

Wallet and SDK clients must resolve attestation metadata from `/.well-known/fpc.json` using `(network_id, asset_address, fpc_address)`. For Alpha, this contract is fixed in [`wallet-discovery-spec.md`](./wallet-discovery-spec.md) and is treated as normative for integration behavior.

---

## 5. Top-up Service

### 5.1 Responsibilities

- Periodically read the FPC's Fee Juice balance on L2
- When balance < `threshold`, bridge via `L1FeeJuicePortalManager.bridgeTokensPublic(...)` on L1
- Prevent multiple concurrent bridges with an in-flight guard

### 5.2 Configuration

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `fpc_address` | FPC contract on L2 |
| `aztec_node_url` | PXE/node RPC |
| `l1_rpc_url` | L1 Ethereum RPC |
| `l1_operator_private_key` | L1 wallet key (can be supplied via env/config/secret provider) |
| `l1_operator_secret_provider` | Secret source strategy (`auto`, `env`, `config`, `kms`, `hsm`) |
| `runtime_profile` | `development` / `test` / `production` (production rejects plaintext config secrets) |
| `threshold` | Bridge when balance below this (wei) |
| `top_up_amount` | Amount to bridge per event (wei) |
| `check_interval_ms` | Polling interval |

`l1_chain_id` and Fee Juice L1 contract addresses are derived from `nodeInfo` and the service validates that the configured `l1_rpc_url` matches the node's L1 chain id.
For `aztec start --local-network`, FeeJuice L1 contracts are bootstrap-provisioned by local-network and must be discovered from node info; do not add a manual custom L1 FeeJuice deployment step.

### 5.3 Bridge Mechanics

1. Service builds an L1 wallet client and uses `L1FeeJuicePortalManager.new(node, client, logger)`
2. Manager performs Fee Juice token approval and portal deposit, returning L1→L2 message metadata
3. Service waits for L1→L2 message readiness (`waitForL1ToL2MessageReady`) using the returned message hash
4. Service still polls FPC Fee Juice balance and treats positive balance delta as the final fallback/confirmation signal

### 5.4 Local-Network Troubleshooting

1. Stale hardcoded addresses
- Symptom: quote/address mismatch or topup failures after local-network restart.
- Check: compare configured addresses with fresh `nodeInfo`.
- Fix: remove hardcoded FeeJuice addresses and regenerate runtime config from current deploy/node output.

2. L1 chain-id mismatch
- Symptom: topup startup or bridge submit fails with chain mismatch errors.
- Check: confirm `l1_rpc_url` chain id matches node-reported L1 chain id.
- Fix: point `l1_rpc_url` to the L1 RPC associated with the active local-network instance.

3. FeeJuice portal/address mismatch
- Symptom: bridge submission succeeds on L1 but no expected FeeJuice balance increase on L2.
- Check: verify FeeJuice token/portal addresses against node-reported L1 contract addresses.
- Fix: use node-derived FeeJuice addresses; avoid manual overrides for local-network.

## 6. Deployment Guide

### 6.1 Prerequisites

- Aztec node running and accessible
- This repository checked out with `vendor/aztec-standards` submodule initialized
- L1 Ethereum RPC (Infura, Alchemy, or local node)
- L1 wallet with ETH for bridging
- An Aztec account for the operator

### 6.2 Compile and Deploy the Contract

```bash
# From repo root
aztec compile --workspace --force

# Deploy FPC (manual)
# operator_pubkey_x/y are the operator Schnorr signing pubkey coordinates.
aztec deploy \
  --artifact target/fpc-FPCMultiAsset.json \
  --args <operator_address> <operator_pubkey_x> <operator_pubkey_y>
```

Record the deployed contract address — you'll need it in both service configs.

### 6.3 Start the Attestation Service

```bash
cd services/attestation
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml: set fpc_address, accepted_asset_*, rates
# For multi-asset, set supported_assets entries and optional per-asset pricing overrides.
# Optionally set discovery identity fields (network_id, contract_variant, quote_base_url)
# Provide operator key via OPERATOR_SECRET_KEY env var
bun install
bun run build
bun run start
```

### 6.4 Start the Top-up Service

```bash
cd services/topup
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml: set fpc_address, aztec_node_url, l1_rpc_url
# Provide bridge key via L1_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY (recommended) or config.l1_operator_private_key
# l1_chain_id and fee juice L1 addresses come from nodeInfo
bun install
bun run build
bun run start
```

### 6.5 Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Check attestation service health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check wallet discovery metadata
curl http://localhost:3000/.well-known/fpc.json

# Get accepted asset info
curl http://localhost:3000/asset

# Get a quote for your address
curl "http://localhost:3000/quote?user=<your_aztec_address>&accepted_asset=<asset_address>&fj_amount=1000000"
```

## 7. Integrating from a Wallet / SDK

```typescript
// 0. Resolve attestation endpoint using (network_id, asset_address, fpc_address)
const discovery = await resolveFpcDiscovery({
  networkId: NETWORK_ID,
  assetAddress: ACCEPTED_ASSET,
  fpcAddress: FPC_ADDRESS,
});
const quotePath = discovery.endpoints.quote;
const quoteUrl = new URL(quotePath, discovery.quote_base_url).toString();

// 1. Choose fj_amount for your gas settings and fetch a user-specific quote.
// For FPC this must match max_gas_cost_no_teardown for the tx being built.
const fjAmount = "1000000";
const quote = await fetch(
  `${quoteUrl}?user=${wallet.getAddress()}&accepted_asset=${ACCEPTED_ASSET}&fj_amount=${fjAmount}`
)
  .then(r => r.json());
const quoteSigBytes = Array.from(
  Buffer.from(quote.signature.replace("0x", ""), "hex")
);

// 2. Create authwit using quoted aa_payment_amount.
const NONCE = Fr.random();

// 3. Create a token transfer authwit (user authorises FPC to pull the charge)
const tokenAuthwit = await wallet.createAuthWit(wallet.getAddress(), {
  caller: FPC_ADDRESS,
  action: Token.at(ACCEPTED_ASSET).transfer_private_to_private(
    wallet.getAddress(), OPERATOR_ADDRESS, BigInt(quote.aa_payment_amount), NONCE
  ),
});

// 4. Build fee_entrypoint call and use it as payment method payload
const feeEntrypointCall = await FPC.at(FPC_ADDRESS).methods
  .fee_entrypoint(
    ACCEPTED_ASSET,
    NONCE,
    BigInt(quote.fj_amount),
    BigInt(quote.aa_payment_amount),
    BigInt(quote.valid_until),
    quoteSigBytes
  )
  .getFunctionCall();

const paymentMethod = {
  getAsset: async () => ProtocolContractAddress.FeeJuice,
  getExecutionPayload: async () =>
    new ExecutionPayload([feeEntrypointCall], [tokenAuthwit], [], [], FPC_ADDRESS),
  getFeePayer: async () => FPC_ADDRESS,
  getGasSettings: () => undefined,
};

// 5. Send user tx with custom fee payment method
const tx = await SomeContract.at(TARGET).someMethod(args).send({
  fee: {
    paymentMethod,
    gasSettings: YOUR_GAS_SETTINGS,
  },
});
```

> **Note:** The wallet must know `OPERATOR_ADDRESS` to construct the token transfer authwit. This can be fetched from the contract's public storage or hardcoded per deployment.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### Operator key
- The `operator` key receives all fee revenue and signs all quotes. It is a single key with no separation of duties. Compromise allows fake quotes (user overcharge) and, critically, receipt of funds.
- Use a hardware wallet or KMS in production. Services support secret-provider modes (`env`, `kms`, `hsm`); `runtime_profile=production` rejects plaintext config-file secrets.
- There is no on-chain key rotation. If the operator key is compromised, the contract must be redeployed.

### Quote replay
- Quotes are user-specific (`user_address = msg_sender`). A quote signed for user A cannot be used by user B.
- Consumed quotes are nullified on-chain (`push_nullifier(quote_hash)`), so the exact same quote cannot be reused (even by the same user).
- Keep `quote_validity_seconds` short (default service cap is 3600s; practical deployments should use much shorter windows).

### Setup-phase irreversibility
- The token transfer executes directly inside the setup phase, before `end_setup()`. It is irrevocably committed.
- If the user's app logic reverts, the fee has still been paid. This is unavoidable in the Aztec FPC model — users accept this when using any FPC.

### No on-chain asset whitelist
- The contract does not enforce an allowlist in storage. Protection comes from quote binding: `accepted_asset` is in the signed preimage, so tampering the asset at call time invalidates signature verification.

### Top-up service
- The L1 operator key needs ETH for gas and Fee Juice bridging. Keep only the needed float; replenish from a cold wallet.
- The service has a simple in-flight guard. If the process crashes mid-bridge, the L1 tx still completes and L2 will receive the funds.

---

## 9. Known Limitations (Alpha)

- **No key rotation.** The packed config is `PublicImmutable`. Operator key compromise requires redeployment.
- **Operator tracks revenue off-chain.** All payments arrive as private notes in the operator's balance. The operator must use their PXE to discover incoming notes and maintain off-chain accounting.
- **`fj_amount` must match tx gas settings (FPC).** Wallets must request a quote with `fj_amount = max_gas_cost_no_teardown` for the exact gas settings used at submission. If they diverge, `fee_entrypoint` rejects with quoted-fee mismatch.
- **No oracle integration.** Rates are set manually in config. A service restart reloads from config.yaml.
- **Top-up service confirmation now combines message readiness + balance checks.** If message checks fail transiently, the balance-delta fallback still prevents blind success reporting.
