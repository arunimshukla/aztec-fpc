# Cold-Start Flow

> [!NOTE]
> **Audience**
>
> Bridge builders and cross-chain wallet teams. The cold-start flow solves the onboarding gap between "funds arrived on L2" and "first transaction."

## What cold-start does

Without cold-start, onboarding from L1 requires multiple steps: bridge tokens, acquire Fee Juice separately, claim, then transact. Cold-start collapses this into one transaction: claim bridged tokens, pay the FPC operator's fee, and deliver the remainder to the user's private balance.

<summary>How it differs from the standard fee flow</summary>

| | Standard `fee_entrypoint` | `cold_start_entrypoint` |
|---|---|---|
| Prerequisite | User has an existing L2 token balance + a deployed account | Neither. Tokens are still on the L1-to-L2 bridge. Account may not exist on L2 yet. |
| Payment source | Private note the user already holds | The claim itself. Bridged amount is split between fee and user. |
| Quote endpoint | `GET /quote` | `GET /cold-start-quote` (different domain separator `"FPCs"` = `0x46504373`) |
| Quote preimage | 7 fields | 9 fields (adds `claim_amount` + `claim_secret_hash`) |
| Gas simulation | Yes (`simulate({fee:{estimateGas:true}})`) | No. Uses hardcoded `Gas(5_000, 1_000_000)` because the user's account may not exist, so the PXE cannot simulate. |

The attestation service validates `claim_amount >= aa_payment_amount` before signing. A cold-start quote whose claim is too small to cover the fee is rejected by the service, not on-chain.

## Integration step by step

### Prerequisites

You need the operator's FPC deployment details: FPC address, attestation URL, accepted token, operator address, and bridge address.

- Integrating against the Nethermind-operated testnet? See **[Testnet Deployment](../reference/testnet-deployment.md)**.
- Integrating against a custom operator? Resolve via [`.well-known/fpc.json`](../services.md#wallet-discovery) using the key `(network_id, asset_address, fpc_address)`.

The bridge address is recorded in the token manifest (`deployments/tokens/<TokenName>.json`) if test tokens were deployed via `configure-token`. For production tokens with an existing address, obtain the bridge address from the token's deployment records or the operator.

### 1. Bridge the tokens from L1

Use the standard Aztec.js `L1ToL2TokenPortalManager` to bridge tokens. The returned `bridgeClaim` object carries everything the cold-start quote needs.

```typescript
import { L1ToL2TokenPortalManager } from "@aztec/aztec.js/ethereum";

// Set up portalManager with your L1 client, token address, and portal address.
// See: https://docs.aztec.network/developers/tutorials/token-bridge

const bridgeClaim = await portalManager.bridgeTokensPrivate(
  userAddress,         // destination on L2
  10_000_000_000_000_000n,
  false,               // mint = false (existing token)
);
```

### 2. Wait for the L1-to-L2 message to land

L2 cannot see the bridged tokens until the L1-to-L2 message is included. For Aztec sandbox this takes seconds. For testnet, expect up to a few minutes.

```typescript
import { waitForL1ToL2MessageReady } from "@aztec/aztec.js/messaging";
import { Fr } from "@aztec/aztec.js/fields";

await waitForL1ToL2MessageReady(
  node,
  Fr.fromHexString(bridgeClaim.messageHash as string),
  { timeoutSeconds: 300 },
);
```

### 3. Execute cold-start

Pass the `bridgeClaim` as-is. Do **not** destructure it. The SDK reads `claimAmount`, `claimSecret`, `claimSecretHash`, and `messageLeafIndex` off the object.

```typescript
import { AztecAddress } from "@aztec/aztec.js/addresses";
import { FpcClient } from "@nethermindeth/aztec-fpc-sdk";

const fpcClient = new FpcClient({
  fpcAddress: AztecAddress.fromString(FPC_ADDRESS),
  operator: AztecAddress.fromString(OPERATOR_ADDRESS),
  node,
  attestationBaseUrl: ATTESTATION_URL,
});

const result = await fpcClient.executeColdStart({
  wallet,
  userAddress,
  tokenAddress: AztecAddress.fromString(TOKEN_ADDRESS),
  bridgeAddress: AztecAddress.fromString(BRIDGE_ADDRESS),
  bridgeClaim,
});

console.log(`Tx: ${result.txHash}`);
console.log(`User received: ${bridgeClaim.claimAmount - result.aaPaymentAmount}`);
console.log(`Operator received (fee): ${result.aaPaymentAmount}`);
```

## What the single transaction does

[Source: `cold_start_entrypoint` in `contracts/fpc/src/main.nr`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/aztec-fpc/blob/main/contracts/fpc/src/main.nr#L141)

```
cold_start_entrypoint(
  user, accepted_asset, bridge,
  claim_amount, claim_secret, claim_secret_hash, message_leaf_index,
  fj_fee_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, quote_sig,
):
  Setup phase:
    1. Assert this is the tx root (maybe_msg_sender().is_none())
    2. Assert claim_amount >= aa_payment_amount
    3. Verify the cold-start quote (Schnorr, domain sep "FPCs", bound to `user` parameter)
    4. Push quote nullifier (replay protection)
    5. Assert fj_fee_amount == get_max_gas_cost(...)
    6. set_as_fee_payer() + end_setup()
  App phase:
    7. Call bridge.claim_private(fpc_address, claim_amount, claim_secret, message_leaf_index)
       -> mints claim_amount of the token to the FPC
    8. Transfer (claim_amount - aa_payment_amount) -> user (private)
    9. Transfer aa_payment_amount (token) -> operator (private)
    10. Protocol deducts fj_amount Fee Juice from FPC's balance to pay fees
```

One proof, one transaction, three private transfers (claim + user split + operator split). Fees are paid from the claim itself. The user never needs prior L2 state.

## Gas limits: why they are hardcoded

`executeColdStart` does **not** simulate. It uses `Gas(5_000, 1_000_000)` as a fixed upper bound. Two reasons the SDK cannot simulate:

1. The user's **account may not exist on L2 yet**, so the PXE cannot simulate through a normal account entrypoint.
2. The **quote signature is a function argument**, but the quote is needed to simulate. This is a circular dependency.

The hardcoded limits come from the cold-start benchmark's worst case (measured DA 1,568, L2 711,103) with safety margin. Unused Fee Juice stays in the FPC's balance; `aztec-fpc` does not use the optional teardown phase, so there is no refund.

Re-measure after contract changes:

```bash
./profiling/setup.sh && ./profiling/run.sh
```

## Edge cases to handle in your UI

| Scenario | What happens | UI should |
|---|---|---|
| Claim amount too small to cover fee | Attestation returns HTTP 400 before signing | Tell user "bridge more" or add a subsidy |
| L1-to-L2 message not yet ready | SDK throws `"Message not in state"`, retries up to 3 attempts total | Show "waiting for L1 confirmation" spinner. The SDK handles retry. |
| Quote expired between fetch and submit | On-chain revert | Re-fetch and retry. Quotes typically live ~5 minutes, capped at 1 hour. |
| User already has an L2 account | Still works. Cold-start is usable by any user, not just new accounts. | Prefer `createPaymentMethod` if the user already has an L2 balance (cheaper, supports gas estimation). |
| Same `bridgeClaim` submitted twice | Second transaction reverts (nullifier conflict) | Track submission state in your UI |

## Picking between cold-start and standard flows

Use **cold-start** when:
- The user is transacting for the first time on L2
- Tokens are arriving from an L1 bridge in this same user session
- You do not have a reliable way to know if the user already has L2 balance

Use **standard `fee_entrypoint`** (via `createPaymentMethod`) when:
- The user already has tokens on L2
- The user already has a deployed account
- You want accurate gas estimation (cold-start uses fixed limits, which will almost always overpay)

Most bridge UIs need **both**: cold-start for the first session, standard flow for returning users.
