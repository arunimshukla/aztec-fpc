description: How the four components of the FPC system interact to abstract fee payments on Aztec.

# Architecture

The FPC system uses four components: a smart contract on Aztec L2, two operator-run off-chain services, and a client-side SDK.

> [!TIP]
> **Where do you fit?**
>
> - **Wallet team**: deploy the contract, run attestation + top-up, integrate the SDK in your wallet UI.
> - **dApp or DEX**: use the SDK against an operator you trust, or run your own attestation service. You never touch the contract directly.
> - **Bridge builder**: use the SDK's `executeColdStart()`. The [Cold-Start flow diagram](#cold-start) below is what matters to you.

## Component roles

### FPC contract (on-chain)

[Source: `contracts/fpc/src/main.nr`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/aztec-fpc/blob/main/contracts/fpc/src/main.nr#L23)

The core smart contract deployed on Aztec L2, written in Noir (Aztec.nr).

Storage is a single packed immutable config slot containing `operator`, `operator_pubkey_x`, and `operator_pubkey_y`. There is no mutable admin state after deployment.

**Responsibilities:**

- Holds a Fee Juice balance to pay fees on behalf of users
- Verifies Schnorr-signed fee quotes from the operator against the stored public key
- Calls `transfer_private_to_private` to move the user's payment token to the operator's private balance
- Declares itself as fee payer via `set_as_fee_payer()` and ends the setup phase with `end_setup()`
- Pushes the quote hash as a nullifier to prevent replay

**Two entrypoints:**

- `fee_entrypoint(accepted_asset, authwit_nonce, fj_fee_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, quote_sig)` for users with an existing L2 token balance
- `cold_start_entrypoint` for new users claiming bridged L1 tokens and paying in one transaction

The token transfer is irrevocably committed in the setup phase (the non-revertible phase). `aztec-fpc` does not schedule a teardown phase. See [Security Model: setup-phase irreversibility](./security.md#trust-assumptions).

### Attestation service (off-chain)

[Source: `services/attestation/src/server.ts`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/aztec-fpc/blob/main/services/attestation/src/server.ts#L817)

A Fastify REST API run by the FPC operator.

**Responsibilities:**

- Accepts quote requests with `user`, `accepted_asset`, and `fj_amount` parameters
- Computes exchange rates using `market_rate_num / market_rate_den` plus operator margin (`fee_bips`)
- Signs quotes with the operator's Schnorr private key using `computeInnerAuthWitHash` from `@aztec/stdlib/auth-witness`
- Serves wallet discovery metadata at `GET /.well-known/fpc.json`
- Manages asset pricing policies via admin endpoints (add, update, remove assets at runtime)
- Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring

For multi-asset deployments, each `supported_assets` entry can override the top-level rate values with asset-specific `market_rate_num`, `market_rate_den`, and `fee_bips`.

### Top-up service (off-chain)

[Source: `services/topup/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/aztec-fpc/blob/main/services/topup/src/index.ts#L527)

A background daemon that keeps the FPC solvent.

**Responsibilities:**

- Periodically reads the FPC's Fee Juice balance on L2
- When balance drops below `threshold`, bridges Fee Juice via `L1FeeJuicePortalManager.bridgeTokensPublic(...)` on L1
- Tracks in-flight bridges in LMDB for crash recovery
- Waits for L1-to-L2 message readiness, with balance-delta polling as a fallback confirmation signal
- Optionally auto-claims bridged tokens on L2

Configuration fields `l1_chain_id` and Fee Juice L1 contract addresses are derived from `nodeInfo`. The service validates that the configured `l1_rpc_url` matches the node's L1 chain ID.

### SDK (client-side)

[Source: `sdk/src/payment-method.ts`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/aztec-fpc/blob/main/sdk/src/payment-method.ts#L50)

A TypeScript library (`@nethermindeth/aztec-fpc-sdk`) wrapping the attestation API and Aztec.js.

**Responsibilities:**

- Fetches quotes from the attestation service
- Constructs `FeePaymentMethod` objects for Aztec.js
- Handles authorization witnesses (authwits) for the token transfer
- Supports both standard (`createPaymentMethod`) and cold-start (`executeColdStart`) flows

## Data flows

### Standard fee payment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as User Wallet
    participant A as Attestation Service
    participant F as Aztec L2 (FPC)

    W->>A: 1. GET /quote
    A-->>W: 2. Signed quote
    W->>F: 3. Submit tx with FPC fee payer
    Note over F: 4. fee_entrypoint()<br/>Verify quote, transfer token, pay fees
    F-->>W: 5. Tx confirmed
```

The contract verifies the Schnorr signature, pushes a nullifier for replay protection, transfers the user's token to the operator, and declares itself as fee payer. For the full step-by-step verification sequence, see [Quote System: Lifecycle](./quote-system.md#lifecycle).

### Cold start

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant L1 as L1 (Ethereum Portal)
    participant A as Attestation Service
    participant F as Aztec L2 (FPC + Bridge)

    U->>L1: 0. Bridge tokens L1 to L2
    U->>A: 1. GET /cold-start-quote
    A-->>U: 2. Signed cold-start quote
    U->>F: 3. Submit cold_start tx
    Note over F: 4. cold_start_entrypoint()<br/>Assert tx root (no nested calls)<br/>Assert claim >= fee<br/>Verify quote + push nullifier<br/>Assert fj_fee_amount == max_fee<br/>set_as_fee_payer() + end_setup()<br/>Claim from bridge into FPC<br/>Transfer remainder to user<br/>Transfer fee to operator
    F-->>U: 5. User has L2 tokens
```

The cold-start quote uses a different domain separator (`0x46504373`, ASCII `FPCs`) and includes `claim_amount` and `claim_secret_hash` in the hash preimage. This prevents cross-entrypoint quote reuse.

### Top-up

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Top-up Service
    participant L1 as L1 (Ethereum)
    participant L2 as Aztec L2

    T->>L2: 1. Check FPC balance
    Note over T: 2. Balance < threshold
    T->>L1: 3. Bridge Fee Juice
    Note over T: 4. Persist to LMDB
    T->>L2: 5. Poll for confirmation
    T->>L2: 6. Auto-claim (optional)
    Note over T: 7. Clear state
```

The service uses `L1FeeJuicePortalManager.new(node, client, logger)` to build the L1 client. After submitting the bridge transaction, it waits for L1-to-L2 message readiness via `waitForL1ToL2MessageReady`, then continues polling the FPC Fee Juice balance as a final fallback confirmation signal. An in-flight guard prevents multiple concurrent bridges. If the process crashes mid-bridge, the L1 transaction still completes and L2 receives the funds.

## Interface map

| From | To | Interface | Protocol |
|------|----|-----------|----------|
| Wallet/SDK | Attestation | HTTP REST | `GET /quote`, `GET /cold-start-quote`, `GET /accepted-assets`, `GET /.well-known/fpc.json` |
| Wallet/SDK | FPC Contract | Aztec tx | `fee_entrypoint()`, `cold_start_entrypoint()` |
| Top-up | L1 Portal | Ethereum tx | `L1FeeJuicePortalManager.bridgeTokensPublic()` |
| Top-up | Aztec L2 | Aztec tx | `FeeJuice.claim()` (auto-claim) |
| Attestation | Aztec Node | PXE RPC | Gas estimation, operator note discovery, `node_getNodeInfo` |
| FPC Contract | Token Contract | Aztec call (private) | `transfer_private_to_private(user, operator, amount, nonce)` |

## Operator model

A single operator runs both off-chain services and holds the keys.

| Key | Purpose | Rotation |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **L2 Schnorr keypair** | Signs quotes; pubkey stored immutably in FPC contract | Requires contract redeployment |
| **L1 private key** | Bridges Fee Juice from L1 | Config change + service restart |
| **Admin API key** | Protects attestation admin endpoints | Env var change + service restart |

The operator earns revenue from the spread between Fee Juice cost and token payment (`fee_bips`). All fee payments arrive directly in the operator's private balance as private notes. The operator must use their PXE to discover incoming notes and maintain off-chain accounting.

> [!TIP]

> For production deployments, use KMS or HSM for operator keys. See [Security Model](./security.md) for key management details and the production checklist.

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Contracts](./contracts.md) index for source links; per-contract detail in [`contracts/fpc/README.md`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/aztec-fpc/blob/main/contracts/fpc/README.md) and the `.nr` sources.
- Use the [SDK](./sdk.md) to integrate fee abstraction into a wallet or dApp.
