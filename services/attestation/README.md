# Attestation Service

This service is the quote signer for fee payment flows. It exposes HTTP endpoints that return short-lived, user-bound Schnorr signatures over quoted amounts. Those signatures are consumed by on-chain contracts to authorize exact private token charges.

## What This Service Does

At startup, the service:

1. Loads config from `config.yaml` plus env overrides.
2. Opens the LMDB asset policy store at `asset_policy_state_path` (seeds from config on first boot).
3. Resolves operator secret key (`env`, `config`, `kms`, or `hsm` mode).
4. Derives the operator signing public key.
5. Verifies on-chain constructor immutables for the configured contract address:
   - `operator`
   - `operator_pubkey_x`
   - `operator_pubkey_y`
6. Lazily reconstructs the operator wallet when PXE-backed sender registration, balance reads, or sweeps are needed.
7. Starts Fastify and serves quote/admin endpoints.

At quote time (`GET /quote`), the service:

1. Authorizes request (depending on `quote_auth_mode`).
2. Applies fixed-window rate limiting.
3. Validates `user`, `accepted_asset`, and `fj_amount` (positive `u128`).
4. Ensures `accepted_asset` is listed in configured `supported_assets`.
5. Resolves per-asset pricing policy for the selected asset.
6. Computes final rate with margin:
   - `rate_num = market_rate_num * (10000 + fee_bips)`
   - `rate_den = market_rate_den * 10000`
7. Computes exact token payment:
   - `aa_payment_amount = ceil(fj_amount * rate_num / rate_den)`
8. Computes `valid_until` from current chain timestamp + `quote_validity_seconds`.
9. Signs the quote hash:
   - `computeInnerAuthWitHash([0x465043, fpc_address, accepted_asset, fj_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, user])`
10. Returns the signed quote payload.

Notes:

- Quotes are user-specific (`user` must match `msg_sender` in contract execution).
- Replays are prevented on-chain by nullifying quote hash.
- The service name/config key uses `fpc_address`, targeting the `FPC` contract which verifies the quote preimage structure.

## Wiring to `/contracts/fpc`

Contract reference: `contracts/fpc/src/main.nr`

How it connects:

1. `FPC.fee_entrypoint(accepted_asset, authwit_nonce, fj_fee_amount, aa_payment_amount, valid_until, quote_sig)` expects the service quote fields directly.
2. `FPC.assert_valid_quote(...)` recomputes the same hash preimage and verifies Schnorr signature against the stored operator pubkey.
3. It enforces quote expiry and replay protection (`push_nullifier(quote_hash)`).
4. It enforces `fj_fee_amount == get_max_gas_cost(...)`.
5. It transfers exactly `aa_payment_amount` of `accepted_asset` from user to operator via authwit-backed `transfer_private_to_private`.

Implication: for `FPC`, clients should request `/quote` with `fj_amount = get_max_gas_cost` for the transaction they are building.

## Single-Instance vs Multi-Instance Setup

Each attestation instance is bound to one contract address (`fpc_address`) and can support multiple assets via `supported_assets`.

- Use one instance per deployed `FPC` address.
- Configure `supported_assets` with the initial wallet-facing asset set.
- Runtime admin changes persist to the LMDB store at `asset_policy_state_path`; after the first admin mutation it becomes the authoritative supported-asset source across restarts.
- Optional per-asset pricing overrides are read from each `supported_assets` entry (`market_rate_num`, `market_rate_den`, `fee_bips`).

## Admin Capabilities

Authenticated admin endpoints are guarded by the `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var and the `admin_api_key_header` config field.

- `GET /admin/asset-policies`
  - Returns the effective persisted asset-policy set.
- `PUT /admin/asset-policies/:assetAddress`
  - Upserts a supported asset with `{ name, market_rate_num, market_rate_den, fee_bips }`.
- `DELETE /admin/asset-policies/:assetAddress`
  - Removes a supported asset. The last remaining asset cannot be removed.
- `GET /admin/operator-balances`
  - Reads operator private balances for the currently supported assets.
- `POST /admin/sweeps`
  - Manually transfers operator-held private token balances to another Aztec address.
  - Body: `{ accepted_asset, amount?, destination? }`
  - If `destination` is omitted, the service uses `treasury_destination_address`.

## Admin Authentication

Admin endpoints are disabled unless the `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var is set.

How it works:

- Every admin request must include the configured `admin_api_key_header` header.
- The header value must exactly match the `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var.
- The service compares the presented value using constant-time digest comparison.
- If `ADMIN_API_KEY` is not set, admin endpoints return `503` and are unavailable.

What this protects:

- Only callers that know the shared admin secret can use admin endpoints.

What this does not provide:

- No per-admin user identity
- No multiple keys or key IDs
- No revocation list or rotation API
- No built-in IP allowlist or mTLS

Operational guidance:

- Treat `ADMIN_API_KEY` like any production secret.
- Serve the service only behind HTTPS or another encrypted trusted hop.
- Do not commit the key to git.
- Inject the key through environment variables or deployment secrets.

### Generating an Admin API Key

Generate a long random secret offline and provision the same value to:

- the `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var on the service
- the trusted admin client or operator tooling

Examples:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

```bash
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'
```

Example env setup:

```bash
export ADMIN_API_KEY="replace-with-random-secret"
# Optional: override header name (default: x-admin-api-key)
# export ADMIN_API_KEY_HEADER="x-admin-api-key"
```

Example request:

```bash
curl \
  -H "x-admin-api-key: replace-with-random-secret" \
  http://localhost:3000/admin/asset-policies
```

Operational notes:

- If the operator account was deployed with a non-zero salt, set `operator_account_salt`; quote signing can work without it, but treasury sweeps cannot reconstruct the correct account otherwise.
- If `pxe_data_directory` is set, the service registers quote request senders in the embedded wallet so later private note discovery for operator-held payments is stable across restarts.
